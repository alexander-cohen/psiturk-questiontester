            At each junction there will be a series of possible questions, but you also have a choice.
            You get one chance to guess an object, and you have to decide when to stop asking your questions
            and guess your object. The first round is for practice, but after that you will be playing for a bonus!
            You will start with $X, and each question you ask the bonus will go down by $X. But be careful, because 
            if you guess incorrectly you dont win anything!
        </p>
