		    In this task you will be asked to play 20 questions. The way it will work is you are asked to choose your favorite question
            between 4 options. When you submit this question, you will recieve an answer based on the item the computer is thinking of. 
            The answers are on a scale from Definitely Not to Definitely Yes, meaning that if it is all the way to one end it is certain,
            if it is in the middle it is either unapplicable or uncertain, and if it is leaning towards one end it means that the answer is
            leaning toward that answer, but is not completely certain. This could mean the answer is something like "Probably" or "Sometimes".
