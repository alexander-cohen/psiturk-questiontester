            When you select a question, answers are given on a 5 point scale from 
            "Definitely Not" to "Definitely Yes." We use this scale because sometimes questions are ambiguous or unclear regarding whether they apply to a certain object. All of the knowledge in our database is the result of human ratings, so it's possible that someone made a mistake or has a different opinion than you.

            <br><br>
            Here are a few examples relating to the object <b>EARPHONES</b>
            <br><br>
            <h4>Question: IS IT WHITE?</h4>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left:-109px"><img src="/static/images/slider_u.png"  alt="Unknown/Not applicable" width=650></div>
            Earphones can be white (but don't have to be), so this person responded in the middle of the scale.
            <hr>

            <h4>Question: IS IT CLOTHING?</h4>
            <br>
            <div style="margin-left:-109px"><img src="/static/images/slider_pn.png"  alt="Unknown/Not applicable" width=650></div>
            It is somewhat ambiguous whether or not earphones are clothing.
            <hr>

            <h4>Question: IS IT ALIVE?</h4>

            <br>
            <div style="margin-left:-109px"><img src="/static/images/slider_n.png"  alt="Unknown/Not applicable" width=650></div>
            Earphones are definitely not alive, so the person answered "definitely not."

            Be aware that itâ€™s possible some entried are a mistake, or that it differs with your intuition.
            
=======
            As you can see, uncertain responses can be interpreted in a variety of ways. 
            Maybe it's because the answer can be "yes" but doesn't have to be. It's also possible that the question is ambiguous or inapplicable.
